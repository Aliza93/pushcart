  %h2 Your endpoint address

  %p Your endpoint e-mail is a filter for grabbing your grocery receipt data. Here's yours:

  %p
    %b= @user.endpoint_email_with_uri

  %p
    Want to change you endpoint e-mail to something else?
    - if mailer
      = link_to 'Click here.', url_with_login_token(@user, edit_user_url(@user))
    - else
      = link_to 'Click here.', edit_user_path(@user)

  %p Simply send receipts to this address and we'll make sure that we collect all the important data you need to know about your grocery shopping.

  %h2 One last thing to do

  %p To get started collecting your grocery data, all you need to do now is one of the following:

  %ol
    %li
      %p Set up an auto-forwarder to send all grocery receipt e-mails to your endpoint e-mail above. (If you like to micromanage your technology, you can also just manually forward e-mail your receipts.)
    %li
      %p Simply change your contact e-mail address on the grocery site to the endpoint e-mail. (Don't worry -- we will forward all e-mails from them on to you and won't store anything except for data about your purchases.)

.row
  %h2 Keep it for your records

  %p Not sure you'll remember this information, or how to navigate back to this page? Never fear: we've already sent you an e-mail with all the information on this page!
